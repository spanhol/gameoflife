# Conway's Game Of Life

This project is a web-based simulation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970. It explores the evolution of a grid of cells, where each cell can be either alive or dead. Simple rules govern their transitions, leading to emergent complex patterns. This implementation is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Controls

- With the Draw tool selected click on cells in the grid to toggle their state (alive/dead) before (or after) starting the simulation.
- Use the pan tool to move the simulation viewport.
- Use mouse wheel or the buttons + and - to zoom in and out.
- Use the Save button to save the current simulation state to the local storage.
- Use the Load button to restore the last saved simulation state.
- Use the broom to clear the simulation state. 
- Use the Random button to fill the simulation with noise.
- Use the Settings button to adjust simulation speed, change grid size, or toggle cell border.
